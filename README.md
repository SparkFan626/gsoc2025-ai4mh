**AI-powered behavioral analysis for mental health crisis detection**  
GSoC 2025 @ HumanAI

---

## ðŸ§  Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered system for early detection and ongoing monitoring of mental health crisesâ€”including suicide risk, substance use, and emotional distressâ€”using social media data.

By combining natural language processing (NLP), behavioral pattern recognition, and geospatial trend analysis, we seek to create a modular pipeline that detects high-risk language, flags emotional signals, and visualizes crisis trends over time. The goal is to support clinicians, nonprofits, and public health researchers in responding to emerging community-level crises with real-time insights.

**AI-powered behavioral analysis for mental health crisis detection**  
GSoC 2025 @ HumanAI

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered system for early detection and ongoing monitoring of mental health crises—including suicide risk, substance use, and emotional distress—using social media data.

By combining natural language processing (NLP), behavioral pattern recognition, and geospatial trend analysis, we seek to create a modular pipeline that detects high-risk language, flags emotional signals, and visualizes crisis trends over time. The goal is to support clinicians, nonprofits, and public health researchers in responding to emerging community-level crises with real-time insights.
